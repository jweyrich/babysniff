# babysniff

A simple sniffer written from scratch without any libraries.

It's a toy tool that I created to learn more about network protocols. It's still very rudimentary when compared to tcpdump or wireshark.

## Supported protocols

Layer 2
- ETH
- ARP

Layer 3
- ICMP
- IP

Layer 4
- TCP
- UDP

Layer 7
- DNS (wip on EDNS0)
